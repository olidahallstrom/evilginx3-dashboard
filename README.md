- **Activity feed** with real-time events
- **Token export** as JSON files
- **Mobile responsive** design

### Enhanced Evilginx Integration
- Seamless integration with existing Evilginx 3.0 features
- Real-time notifications for new sessions and credential captures
- Export functionality for captured data
- Performance optimizations for heavy traffic

## üìã Quick Start

### Ubuntu/Linux (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run the automated setup script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/evilginx3-dashboard/main/ubuntu_setup.sh

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/evilginx3-dashboard.git
cd evilginx3-dashboard

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the project
go build -o evilginx2 main.go

# Start with dashboard
./evilginx2 -dashboard
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Access

- Success rate calculations

### Activity Feed
- Real-time event notifications
- Session creation alerts
- Credential capture notifications
- Token capture alerts

## üîß Configuration

### Command Line Options
```bash
# Start with dashboard
./evilginx2 -dashboard

# Custom dashboard port
./evilginx2 -dashboard -port 9090

# Enable debug mode
./evilginx2 -dashboard -debug
```

### Performance Tuning
For heavy traffic scenarios, apply the performance patches:
```bash
# Apply performance optimizations
cp dashboard_performance_patch.go core/dashboard.go
go build -o evilginx2 main.go
```

## üö® Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Handles 10-20 concurrent users
- Response time: 5-10 seconds with 1000+ sessions
- May freeze under heavy load

### With Performance Patches
- Handles 100+ concurrent connections
- Response time: <500ms
- No system freezes under load
- Stable memory usage
